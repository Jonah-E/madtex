# MadTex - Markdown to LaTex converter
I started this project to control how my Obsidian notes are converted from markdown to LaTex. This project therefore have two goal:
- Be a markdown to LaTeX converter
- Be a small project for me to learn/use Haskell

If you want a real converter, take a look at [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
